# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hi, I’m Ritesh, I’m a final-year Computer Science (AI & Data Science) undergraduate with a strong interest in system programming, backend development, and building efficient software from the ground up. I enjoy working close to the system—understanding how operating systems work, how data flows through applications, and how performance and reliability can be improved through good design.<br><br>I primarily work with C, C++, Java, and Python, and I have hands-on experience in Linux system programming, including concepts like process management, file systems, memory management, and OS internals. I enjoy writing clean, efficient code and optimizing solutions through strong problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.<br><br>Through academic and industry-oriented projects, I’ve built database-driven applications, custom system utilities, and full-stack components, gaining exposure to SQL-like systems, data persistence, and secure application design. I also have experience working with machine learning applications, where I’ve applied models to real-world problems such as financial risk assessment, combining predictive accuracy with practical usability.<br><br>I actively participate in hackathons and technical competitions, which has helped me work under tight deadlines, collaborate in teams, and turn ideas into working solutions. I was a Finalist at MUFG Hackathon 2025 and participated in Smart India Hackathon 2024. I enjoy contributing my work on GitHub with clear documentation and reusable code, and I believe in learning by building.<br><br>Currently, I’m looking for opportunities where I can apply my system-level knowledge, backend skills, and problem-solving abilities to build scalable, secure, and impactful software systems, while continuing to grow as a software engineer.
